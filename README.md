# Kite Academy Stockholm
Kite Academy Stockholm is a website that aims to attract the attention of potential as well as already committed kitesurfers. The site is a display window for an organization specialising in teaching kite surfing to all interested. The content is focused around services offered to visitors with a clear call to action to sign up for one of the services offered by the academy.

The main page states the purpose and beliefs of the Academy as an introduction, while displaying a set of inspiring images showing kite-surfing on water and on snow. The main page displays information about the range of services offered, the events planned. 

The main page leads over to a second page focusing the equipment needed for kitesurfing. This page highlights how the Academy supports surfers in selecting and eventually acquiring their own equipment. Intersted parties can use a dedicated form to place an inquiry for assistance.

You can access the deployed webpage here [Kite Academy Stockholm](https://jnicolin.github.io/MS1-KiteAcademy/).

# Design
## Images
The images used on the site are chosen to promote the values communicated in text by Kite Academy Stockholm, which are typically "Fun", "Joy", "Nature".

Further the images are chosen to convey the idea that Kitesurfing is for everyone, that it can be mastered and that it is a social and inclusive sport that encourages the cooperation with other surfers. 

Finally, being based in Scandinavia, the summer period is not very long, why the Academy is active with training on snow during winter time, which is an important differentiator for this Academy, and promoted by the images

## Fonts
There are two fonts used in the website. Both quite simplistic and clean, quite natural and straight-forward. As is Kitesurfing. Modern, fast and clean.

## Colors 
The color scheme is based on shades of Blue, Orange and White. 

![Color scheme used](assets/screenshots/color_scheme.png)

- Blue is associated with the sea.
- Orange with the Sun and energy.
- White is for cleanliness, distinction and snow. 

The choice of blue and orange, along with red, is very much used in the Kitesurfing domain on the Web.

## Wireframes, design ideas
All design ideas were scetched out on three different screen sizes to allow for early stage decisions on what works well on small to larger screens. 

### Main page
The landing page design is based on visual impressions from nice kite-related photos, complemented with nice descriptions of services. 

![Wireframe of the main page](assets/screenshots/Wireframe-page-main.png)

### Focus page, Equipment 
Kite-surfing is a materials sport, why the equipment deserves some extra attention. This page is designed to present Kite Academy as a strong partner in getting the right gear. 

During development it was decided to deviate some from the design idea, to add a hero-image on top with overlaying text, for a more engaging impression.

![Wireframe of the page focusing on kite Equipment](assets/screenshots/Wireframe-page-eq.png)

### Form page, Call to action
A form that opens once a CTA-button has been clicked. Allowing visitors to sign up for services offered by the Academy.

![Wireframe of the page with a form for signing up to services](assets/screenshots/Wireframe-page-CTA.png)

### Success page, acknowledgements
A page that pops-up once one of the two forms have been submitted. 

![Wireframe of the pop-up page folllowing a successful submit of a form](assets/screenshots/Wireframe-page-Ack.png)

# Features
## Navbar features re-used across all site
![Navbar](assets/screenshots/Feature_Navbar.png)
The navigation bar is common to all pages for recognition. It is a collapsable navbar that stretches out on larger screens, to become a burger-icon at the breakpoint. 

The Navbar contains the dedicated Logo designed for the Academy. Further, the navbar holds a CTA-button in distinct color to stand out. 

## Main page conveying message of Services
![Main page](assets/screenshots/Feature_MainPage.png)
The main page top has the heading of the Academy to make it clear what site a visitor has landed on, followed by a line stating the main mission of the Academy - "training". The top holds a declaration of what Kite Academy Stockholm values and beliefs.  

## Services section with clear Call To Action
![CTA](assets/screenshots/Feature_Reservation.png)
The content of the main page is dedicated to the services offered by the Academy. They are presented via clean cards with a crisp header, a motivating illustration and the price. 

## Equipment reservation form embedded in the second page 
![Resrvation form](assets/screenshots/Feature_Reservation_Eq.png)
The equipemt page holds a form allowing for requesting access to gear or guidance on gear. It holds mandatory fields for collecting user identfication and addresses.

### Functional testing outcome
The table indicates the outcome before corrections. 
- TC6 wrong link to Instagram
- TC7 missing links to social media
- TC18 no confirmation of a correct submit was shown
- TC19 validation of form failed as it accepted empty fields.
- TC23 the button on the index-page was leading to the top of the index-page rather than to the booking form.
- TC24 there was an absolute link in the URL to the Hero-section background-image. No image was displayed at first deploy.  

All errors listed have been fixed. No errors remain in the deployed version. All testcases now have passed OK.

## Testing for responsiveness
Cross-browser testing was done to validate the responsiveness of the website accross different screensizes and positions. Tools like Chrome Inspect and the dedicated Responsinator.com were used. 

Testing for responsiveness passed OK!

## Automated testing
The Kite Academy site is tested using Chrome Lighthouse for Good practices, Performance and Accessibility.

![Screenshot of the outcome from automated testing of performance](assets/screenshots/AutomaticTesting_Lighthouse.png)

Accessibility score of 79% comes from warnings on 3:rd party cookies associated with the Google maps iFrame. Excluding these gives a result of 100%.

## Validator testing
### HTML validation
- No bugs remaining at validation.  

### CSS validation
- No bugs remaining at validation. 

## Browser testing
The site was tested on the following browsers
- Chrome
- Safari
- Duck duck Go

## Device testing
## Fixed bugs
HTML-related
- A number of open "div", "li" tags left in the code.
- instances of unrelated “/” signs.
- Not allowed signs in the naming of image files, eg the spacebar-signs “ “. 
- Not allowed arguments in the iframe for sizing an embedded frame with Google maps. "Height" and "Width" moved to CSS-file.

### Notable bugs and fixes
-	Visual sizing and positioning of images with varying orignal size and layout. Use of relative measures rather than fixed values worked well. 
-	Many iterations on trimming of paddings and margins to get harmony across all screen sizes. 
-	Some mistakes from copy/paste when reusing code between html-files. Notably reusing Navbar, Footer and custom Button elements.
-   Maintaining the correct aspect ratio was somewhat tricky to a start. 

## Known bugs
There are no known remaining bugs.
